Minesweeper
by
Andrew Quintanilla

Made for Python 3, using pygame 1.9.2.

Things to do:
- Add options for difficulty
	* Beginning, intermediate, hard difficulties
	* Custom difficulty
- Add left+right click functionality
	* Check unflagged tiles surrounding clicked tile if number of 
	  surrounding flagged tiles equals number on clicked tile
- Add leaderboard for times (sqlite?)
- Add pause menu
	* New game, options, view leaderboard, quit
- Replace surfaces with actual graphics (low priority)
- Put in animations (very low priority)
- Add online leaderboard (probably never going to happen)
